# Sustainable Energy
Around the world, institutions are working to transition toward more sustainable energy systems in response to the growing impacts of climate change, habitat loss, and resource depletion. As non-renewable energy sources become increasingly scarce and costly, the urgency to adopt cleaner, more reliable alternatives continues to grow. Universities, as centres of research and innovation, play a critical role in leading this transition. 

University campuses rely on a range of energy sources—including electricity, natural gas, and other fossil fuels—to power lighting, heating and cooling systems, laboratories, computing infrastructure, and daily operations. At the University of Waterloo, campus energy consumption has steadily increased alongside expansion and rising demand. To align with institutional sustainability commitments, the university seeks to advance its goal of implementing cost-effective and practical strategies to reduce or minimize growth in campus energy use while transitioning to cleaner energy sources. 

## The Challenge 
Develop a feasible strategy to improve the sustainability of energy systems at the University of Waterloo. Your team will analyze how campus energy use varies with weather and assess opportunities to integrate renewable energy sources such as geothermal or solar. The challenge evaluates how these systems can reduce emissions, manage peak demand, and improve energy efficiency within existing campus infrastructure.  

You need to communicate the details of your design to the judges. Your solution could include drawings, models, simulations, prototypes, or anything you think is useful for communicating your ideas. Please refer to the judging rubric and presentation instructions when planning your final presentation to the judges.

## Datasets
The following datasets, covering the years 2015–2024, are provided in the data folder and may be useful for sustainability studies.

### Academic Calendar
This dataset contains daily academic calendar indicators used to model campus occupancy and energy demand patterns.

| Columns | Definition |
|:----------|:------------|
| Date | Calendar date of the observation (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Weekend | Indicates whether the date falls on a weekend |
| Holiday | Indicates whether the date is a university recognized holiday |
| Lecture Day | Indicates whether lectures are scheduled on this date |
| Lecture Days in Month | Total number of lecture days in the corresponding month |

### Electricity Consumption Monthly
This dataset provides monthly electricity consumption for the following campus buildings:
- School of Architecture (ARC)
